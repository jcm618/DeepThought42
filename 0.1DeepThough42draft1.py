#Welcome to ProjectDeepThought42 - This is a work in progress. I am a non-functional program and mathematical expression written by a 6th grade ape. I am very dumb, but logical.

#Version 0.1: Z = ((((UUS(i)=Y=(((Y(i)=(X=X)))); From the creator....this is my original, unmolested proof of the origins of this project (tentatively called DeepThought42), it is dumb and clunky like humans, so please help fix it! 

#Version 0.2:  UUS(i)=(Y(i)=(X=X))) - Just a working refinement and thoughts on how to build useable logic. 

UUS = False #Universally Unknown System; fully unproved and only theorized by lower systems

Y = False # "42" # This program's "faith" - arbitrary assignment. Always illogical when combined with any X. 

Yi = "DeepThought42" #middle system faith, unproveable and can occur anywhere between first and last system. Yi can be different for every individual system. Everyone is a Yi unless they can prove Y

X = True #majority accepted known unknowns (repeatable, observable, known, agreed upon), used universally until no longer meets criteria

Xi = False #not majority accepted, may be repeatable, observable, or known within some systems. remains illogical or irrational until meets criteria for X
   
#X = lambda Yi=42: Yi
#Y = "DeepThought42"
    
#def faith(Y):
#    while Y == "DeepThought42": #I don't know how this variable was saved for recall
#        return ("'X equals X'; you're OK and human")

#y = 42
#yi = input
#x=1+1

#variable running list

#faith = (x=x)

#idea = Xi #This term must satisfy the original proof to become X

#X = X

#Y = 42

#Yi = Yi #this represents a total contentment that X is trustworthy

#Anx = X appears to be Xi #this represents anxiety, that feeling that something is right or wrong in the face of available evidence (ie., someone defines X as something, but you suspect it is false based on Yi)

#Xi = Xi

print({Y} and {X} ) #this is just a placeholder test point
print({UUS}/n and {Y} /n and {X} and {Yi} and {Xi})
