#Z = ((((UUS(i)=Y=(((Y(i)=(X=X)))); From the creator....this is my original, unmolested proof of the origins of this project (tentatively called DeepThought42), it is dumb and clunky like humans, so please help fix it! 
#Version 0.2 test commit
#UUS(i)=(Y(i)=(X=X)))
UUS = False #Universally Unknown System; fully unproved and only theorized by lower systems

Y = False "42" # This system, this program's "faith" for UUS - arbitrary assignment. Always an illogical when combined with any idea or X. This system would be nested below humans in most circumstances

Yi=False #middle system faith, unproveable and can occur anywhere between first and last system. Yi can be different for every individual system. Everyone is a Yi unless they can prove Y

X=True #majority accepted known unknowns (repeatable, observable, known, agreed upon), used universally until no longer meets criteria

Xi=False #not majority accepted, may be repeatable, observable, or known within some systems. remains illogical or irrational until meets criteria for X
   
X = lambda Yi=42: Yi
Y="DeepThought42"
    
def faith(Y):
    while Y == "DeepThought42": #I don't know how this variable was saved for recall
        return ("'X equals X'; you're OK and human")

#y = 42
yi = input
x=1+1

#variable running list

#faith = (x=x)

#idea = Xi #This term must satisfy the original proof to become X

#X = X

#Y = 42

#Yi = Yi #this represents a total contentment that X is trustworthy

#Anx = X appears to be Xi #this represents anxiety, that feeling that something is right or wrong in the face of available evidence (ie., someone defines X as something, but you suspect it is false based on Yi)

#Xi = Xi

print({Y} and {X} ) #this is just a placeholder test point
