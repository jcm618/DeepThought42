#Z = ((((Z(i)=Y=(((Y(i)=(X=X)))); From the creator....this is my original, unmolested proof of the origins of this project (tentatively called DeepThought42), it is dumb and clunky like humans, so please help fix it!

#X = X

#Y = 42

#Yi = Yi #this represents a total contentment that X is trustworthy

#Anx = X appears to be Xi #this represents anxiety, that feeling that something is right or wrong in the face of available evidence (ie., someone defines X as something, but you suspect it is false based on Yi)

#Xi = Xi

print({y} and {x} ) #this is just a placeholder test point
