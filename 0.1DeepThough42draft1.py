#Z = ((((Z(i)=Y=(((Y(i)=(X=X)))); From the creator....this is my original, unmolested proof of the origins of this project (tentatively called DeepThought42), it is dumb and clunky like humans, so please help fix it!

    return (a + b)
    
x=(yi=42)
y=DeepThought42
    
def faith(y):

    return ("X equals X"; you're OK and human)

a = int(input('Enter 1st number: '))
b = int(input('Enter 2nd number: '))
#y = 42
yi = input
x=1+1

print(f'Sum of {a} and {b} is {sum(a, b)}')

#variable running list

#faith = (x=x)

#idea = Xi #This term must satisfy the original proof to become X

#X = X

#Y = 42

#Yi = Yi #this represents a total contentment that X is trustworthy

#Anx = X appears to be Xi #this represents anxiety, that feeling that something is right or wrong in the face of available evidence (ie., someone defines X as something, but you suspect it is false based on Yi)

#Xi = Xi

print({y} and {x} ) #this is just a placeholder test point
